# CountryInfoService

> **CountryInfoService** is a simple REST API that provides country-related information, using external APIs.

The code is deployed to Render and can be accessed at [https://countryinfoservice.onrender.com/](https://countryinfoservice.onrender.com/).

## Features
- **Country Information**: Get the name, capital, population, cities of a given country.
  - Optional: Limit the amount of cities returned.
- **Population Information**: Get the population history of a given country.
   - Optional: Get the population history for a given time interval.
- **Status Information**: Get the status of the service and external APIs.

### External APIs
The project integrates the following external APIs to provide country-related information:

- **CountriesNow API**: Used to fetch details about countries, including historical population data and city listings.
- **RestCountries API**: Supplies additional country information, such as capitals, bordering nations, and national flags.

### known issues

- The `/info` endpoint does not return data for South Sudan (`SS`/`SSD`). This is due to the absence of South Sudan in the `CountriesNow API`, preventing the retrieval of its city data.
- The "default" handler does _not_ function correctly on Render, as it attempts to serve the `index.html` file from the `static` directory, which is not currently working.

## Requirements

- Go 1.18+
- External APIs: CountriesNow API and RestCountries API
- Go modules (use `go mod` for managing dependencies)

## Setup

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/SigurdRiseth/CountryInfoService.git
   cd CountryInfoService
    ```
   
2.	Install dependencies (if you havenâ€™t already):

    ```bash
    go mod tidy
    ```

3.	(optional) Create a .env file for environment variables. Hereâ€™s an example of what you might want to include:

    ```bash
    PORT=8080
    ```

4.	Run the service:

    ```bash
    go run main.go
    ```

5.	The service should now be running at http://localhost:8080/.
